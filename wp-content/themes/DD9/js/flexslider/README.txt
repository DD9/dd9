jQuery FlexSlider v1.4
http://flex.madebymufffin.com

A responsive jQuery slider plugin. The plugin is absolutely free to use in private and commerical projects. The plugin includes fade and slide animations, customizable options, and all the navigation options you would expect, including touch gestures. It uses simple, semantic markup to create the slider and is lightweight, weighing only 5 Kb (minified). The plugin has been tested in Safari 4+, Chrome 4+, Firefox 3.6+, Opera 10+, and IE7+. iOS and Android devices are supported as well.
