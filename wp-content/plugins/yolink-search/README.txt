== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q:  I installed yolink Search for WordPress but it's not working right away. What's the deal? =

A:  When you first install yolink Search for WordPress, you need to manually execute the initial Crawl. From the plugin's dashboard, select pages and/or posts and click "Crawl." It may take some time to index your entire site, especially if you have more than a few thousand pages. If you have a site with more than 5,000 pages, please [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp) so we can help with the indexing. 

= Q:  My search results are not working properly. Where can I find developer support forums? =

A:  yolink documentation, developer forums, and extended FAQ can be found [here](http://developer.yolink.com/docs/read/faqs). If your problem persists or if you're unable to find a solution, please [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp).

= Q:  How much does yolink Search for WordPress cost? =

A:  yolink Search is free for personal use, and affordable for business. To find the plan that's right for you, try our [Pricing Wizard](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/pricing/) or review our [detailed pricing](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/api/pricing.jsp). 

= Q:  What if I don't register my API key? =

A: Unregistered API keys are limited to 50 indexed pages per site. If your site contains more than 50 pages, you will need to register the API key (through the link provided in your plugin dashboard) to gain full access to the capabilities of yolink Search for WordPress.

= Q:  I like the yolink excerpts and now I don't want the usual WordPress previews. How do I remove the WordPress previews from my search results page? = 

A:  If you're comfortable editing the functions.php file for your theme, hiding the default WordPress search result blurb should be easy. In your theme's search.php file, add this code: 
`function yolink_custom_css() {
	echo '<style type="text/css">a.yolink-href-key { display:none }</style>';
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'yolink_custom_css' );`

Of course, themes vary, so if this doesn't work you'll have to investigate the code for your default WordPress blurbs.

= Q:  Will yolink Search for WordPress work with any version of WordPress? =

A: yolink Search for WordPress supports PHP 5.2 or greater and WordPress 3.0.5 or greater. 

= Q:  yolink Search for WordPress isn't working with my theme, is there anything I can do? =

A:  While yolink Search for WordPress is designed to work with many themes seamlessly, there may be some that require additional customization. Please [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp) for additional information.

= Q:  What are "yolink sharing services"? After I install yolink Search for WordPress, I don't see the yolink sharing features. How do I activate them? =

A:  yolink sharing services give your users the ability to share/repurpose the information they find on your site or blog. If you want to add any or all of the sharing options, simply check the corresponding boxes in the plugin dashboard.

The first share button allows your users to share search results to EasyBib, Evernote, Delicious, etc. The Google Docs&copy; icon allows your users to save content directly to their Google Docs&copy; accounts. The Facebook button lets your users post content directly to Facebook. The Twitter icon allows your users to tweet out website content. 

= Q:  yolink Search for WordPress is working, but the results clash with my site design. How do I make it mesh well with the current theme I'm using? =

A:  yolink results can be styled with CSS, just not directly through the plugin. If you'd like more information about styling yolink Search for WordPress, please [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp). We are currently working on an FAQ.

= Q:  I'm confident that I've installed yolink Search for WordPress correctly, and I've read the entire FAQ, but it still doesn't appear to be working properly. What could the problem be? =

A:  There may have been an issue in creating the API key during the activation process. Please go to the options page to see if you see, "The API Key for this blog is y0l1nk", where y0l1nk is a series of letters and numbers. If you don't have an API key, please [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp) to get one. 

= Q:  Can I exclude certain types of content from my search results? = 

A:  Yes. In addition to the option of indexing pages, posts, and custom post types you can further customize your search results. Please view our [Developer Documentation](http://developer.yolink.com/docs) or [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp) for assistance.

= Q:  I want to use yolink Search for WordPress for multisite search. Do I need a different API key for each site? =

A:  Yes, each site requires a separate API key for multisite search to work. For each site you manage you'll need to register a new API key in order to search across all of the content that you've indexed on those domains. All of your API keys can be managed from your [yolink account](https://admin.yolink.com/account/signin), or on your WordPress.org yolink settings page. Once you've accepted the agreement with TigerLogic on each of those WordPress installs, you'll be able to register and choose which installs to include in your multisite registration. If you have any questions or need any assistance with multisite search please [contact us](http://www.yolink.com/yolink/product-info/contact-us.jsp).
