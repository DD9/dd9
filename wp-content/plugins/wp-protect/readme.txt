Protect your WordPress site against right clicks, text selection, and image dragging.

== Description ==

Now works with AJAX and jQuery lightboxes! WP-Protect is a plugin for WordPress websites that allows webmasters to protect their content from being stolen. More specifically, it allows webmasters to disable certain features for their website visitors that are popular methods of stealing site content. These anti-features are accomplished by way of javascript coding, so this plugin may not work for some visitors who have disabled javascript in their browser (although this is not common).

While some webmasters feel that these types of scripts are pointless as "savvy" visitors or "hackers" can either disable javascript or "view source" in order to steal your content, we disagree for two reasons. Firstly, the vast majority of internet users are not aware of how to do either of these two things, and are usually the people who unwittingly go around stealing content without thinking twice about it. Secondly, "savvy" visitors will at least be aware that you are closely watching your content for theft, and will indeed think twice about stealing your content, at least without attaching some sort of source attribution.

In any case, such a plugin is in high demand for webmasters trying to cut down on "duplicate content" penalties on search engines that are sometimes (ironically) taken against their very own website, even though they are the original authors of said content.
