= Automating checking e-mail =

By default, postie checks for new e-mail every 30 minutes. You can select from
a number of different checking intervals in the settings page, under the
mailserver tab.

If you would prefer to have more fine-grained control of how postie checks
for mail, you can also set up a crontab. This is for advanced users only.
If your site runs on a UNIX/linux server, and you have shell access, you can
enable mail checking using cron; if you don't know anything about cron, skip
to the cronless postie section.

Setup a cronjob to pull down the get\_mail.php
Examples:

*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get\_mail.php >/dev/null 2>&1

This fetches the mail every five minutes with lynx 

*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O /dev/null http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get\_mail.php >/dev/null 2>&1

This fetches the mail every ten minutes with wget
