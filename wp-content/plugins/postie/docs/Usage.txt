== Usage ==
* If you put in :start - the message processing won't start until it sees that string
* If you put in :end - the message processing will stop once it sees that string
* Posts can be delayed by adding a line with delayXdXhXm where X is a number.
  *    delay:1d - 1 day
  *    delay:1h - 1 hour
  *    delay:1m - 1 minute
  *    delay:1d2h4m - 1 day 2 hours 4m
* By putting comments:X in your message you can control if comments are allowed
   *   comments:0 - means closed
   *   comments:1 - means open
   *   comments:2 - means registered only
* Replying to an e-mail gets posted as a comment. 
  * For example, you e-mailed a post with the subject line "foo".
    If you then send an e-mail with the subject line "Re: foo", it will
    get posted as a comment to the "foo" post. This works by the subject
    line, so if you have two posts with titles "foo", then the comment
    will get placed in the more recent post.
* Custom excerpt
  * You can include a custom excerpt of an e-mail by putting it between
    :excerptstart and :excerptend
    * You can include images in the excerpt by using the shortcode #eimg1#,
      #eimg2# etc.

= Post type =
  You can specify the post type by including it as the first part of the subject
  E.g. <post type>//<real subject>

= Category and tag handling =
* If you put a category name in the subject with a : it will be used
  as the category for the post
* If you put a category id number in the subject with a : it will
  be used as the category for the post
* If you put the first part of a category name it will be posted in
  the first category that the system finds that matches - so if you put

  Subject: Gen: New News

  The system will post that in General.

* All of the above also applies if you put the category in brackets []
* Using [] or you can post to multiple categories at once

  Subject: [1] [Mo] [Br] My Subject

  On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time

* Using - or you can post to multiple categories at once

  Subject: -1- -Mo- -Br- My Subject

  On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time

= Tags =
* You can add tags by adding a line in the body of the message like so:
  tags: foo, bar
* You can also set a default tag to be applied if no tags are included.

= Image Handling =
* Allows you to attach images to your email and automatically post
  them to your blog
* You can publish images in the text of your message by using #img1#
  #img2# - each one will be replaced with the HTML for the image
  you attached
* Captions - you can also add a caption like so:

    * #img1 caption='foo'#
    * #img2 caption='bar'#
  
  Or, if you use IPTC captions, this caption will be used  (adding a caption
  in many photo editing programs (for example Picasa), will add an IPTC caption)

  Note that the images are processed in the order they are attached as of version
  1.4.6.

* Image templates
  Postie now uses the default wordpress image template, but you can specify a
different one if you wish.

  You can also specify a custom image template. I use the following custom
template:

  `<div class='imageframe alignleft'><a href='{IMAGE}'><img src="{THUMBNAIL}"
  alt="{CAPTION}" title="{CAPTION}" 
  class="attachment" /></a><div
  class='imagecaption'>{CAPTION}</div></div>`
     
    * {THUMBNAIL} gets replaced with the url to the thumbnail image
    * {MEDIUM} gets replaced with the url to the medium-sized image
    * {LARGE} gets replaced with the url to the large-sized image
    * {FULL} gets replaced with the url to the full-sized image
    * {FILENAME} gets replaced with the absolute path to the full-size image
    * {RELFILENAME} gets replaced with the relative path to the full-size image
    * {CAPTION} gets replaced with the caption you specified (if any)
    * {WIDTH} gets replaced with width of the photo
    * {HEIGHT} gets replaced with the height of the photo

= Interoperability =
* If your mail client doesn't support setting the subject (nokia) you
  can do so by putting #your title here# at the beginning of your message
* POP3,POP3-SSL,IMAP,IMAP-SSL now supported - last three require
  php-imap support
* The program understands enough about mime to not duplicate post
  if you send an HTML and plain text message
* Automatically confirms that you are installed correctly
