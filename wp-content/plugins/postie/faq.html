<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4 id='answer-0'>How can I get postie to display inline images?</h4>

<p>Make sure that you send e-mail formatted as html (richtext), and set postie to
    prefer html messages (in the message tab of the postie settings)</p>

<h4 id='answer-1'>Mail is not showing up right when I send html (rich formatted) e-mail!</h4>

<p>Make sure you set the preferred text type to html</p>

<h4 id='answer-2'>Do I need to any code to my theme for postie to work?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4 id='answer-3'>I read somewhere to add an iframe to my footer. Should I do this?</h4>

<p>No. Do not add an iframe in your footer to get postie to check mail
    periodically. To check e-mail periodically, either set-up a cron job, or use
    cronless postie. See installation instructions</p>

<h4 id='answer-4'>My mail host requires SSL, but postie will not allow me to select pop3-ssl or imap-ssl</h4>

<p>You must have php-imap installed on your server for this to work. Ask your
    hosting provider about this.</p>

<h4 id='answer-5'>Can I use postie to check a gmail account?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can use either pop3-ssl or imap-ssl with a gmail account. Before
    attempting to use with postie, make sure that you enable pop or imap in your
    gmail preferences.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pop3 settings:

        <ul>
            <li>protocol - pop3-ssl</li>
            <li>server - pop.gmail.com</li>
            <li>port - 995</li>
            <li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is <a href="mailto:foo@gmail.com">foo@gmail.com</a>,
                this would be just foo)</li>
            <li>password - your password </li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>IMAP settings:

        <ul>
            <li>protocol - imap-ssl</li>
            <li>server - imap.gmail.com</li>
            <li>port - 993</li>
            <li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is <a href="mailto:foo@gmail.com">foo@gmail.com</a>,
                this would be just foo)</li>
            <li>password - your password </li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id='answer-6'>My posts show up as being posted by 'admin' instead of me. Why?</h4>

<p>If your admin account is linked to <a href="mailto:bar@gmail.com">bar@gmail.com</a>, and you send mail from
    <a href="mailto:bar@gmail.com">bar@gmail.com</a>, it will show up as being posted by admin. If you have a
    wordpress user named "John Doe", which is linked to <a href="mailto:johndoe@gmail.com">johndoe@gmail.com</a>, make
    sure that you send e-mails from <a href="mailto:johndoe@gmail.com">johndoe@gmail.com</a>. It doesn't matter which
    e-mail address postie is checking. That is, if you send mail from
    <a href="mailto:johndoe@gmail.com">johndoe@gmail.com</a> to <a href="mailto:foo@gmail.com">foo@gmail.com</a>, it gets posted as "John Doe".</p>

<p>If you send an e-mail to your postie address from an e-mail address that is no
    t linked to a wordpress user, it will get posted as admin.</p>

<h4 id='answer-7'>Images aren't showing up at all?</h4>

<p>There are a couple possible reasons for this. First, check to see if you can
    add an image through wordpress's normal posting mechanism. If not, then there
    is probably 1 or 2 problems:
    1. Your server does not have the php-gd library installed. Ask your hosting
    provider about this.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your wp-content/uploads directory is not writable by the webserver. Make
        sure that it is</li>
</ol>

<h4 id='answer-8'>Can I delete the wp-files directory needed by postie version &lt;1.3.0?</h4>

<p>If you have posts published already by older versions of postie, getting rid
    of those directories will delete any files you might have had associated with
    those old posts. If you don't have any such posts, then you can safely delete
    them.</p>

<h4 id='answer-9'>How can I get rid of stupid stuff my e-mail provider adds to my messages?</h4>

<p>To strip off stuff that they add at the beginning of a message, start your
    post with :start</p>

<p>To strip off stuff that they add at the end of a message, end your
    post with :end</p>

<h4 id='answer-10'>How can I add custom attachment icons?</h4>

<p>Simply upload the icons you want to the postie/icons/custom directory. You
    must name the icons according to the following scheme:
    {filetype}-{size}.png</p>

<p>For example, for word documents, you could use:</p>

<pre><code>doc-32.png
</code></pre>

<p>for a 32x32 pixel icon. (You can actually create any size icon you want, but
    if you name it 32, then it will only be used if you select to use size 32
    icons)</p>

<p>See the other directories in icons for more examples.</p>

<p>Currently the following filetypes are supported:</p>

<ul>
    <li>doc - microsoft word (including docx)</li>
    <li>ppt - microsoft powerpoint (including pptx)</li>
    <li>xls - microsoft excel (including xlsx)</li>
    <li>numbers - iWork numbres spreadsheet</li>
    <li>pages - iWork pages document</li>
    <li>key - iWork keynote presentation</li>
    <li>pdf - portable document format</li>
    <li>rtf - rich text format</li>
    <li>txt - plain text document</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='answer-11'>Can I add special text to the body of the post when using postie?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
    Two short examples are included in the filterPostie.php.sample file</p>

<h4 id='answer-12'>Can I add special text to the title of the post when using postie?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
    Two short examples are included in the filterPostie.php.sample file</p>

<h4 id='answer-13'>Can I select tags or categories based on the content of the e-mail?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
    See the filterPostie.php.sample file for examples.</p>

<h4 id='answer-14'>Is the IMAP extension required for postie?</h4>

<p>The IMAP extension is not required, but it is strongly recommended, especially
    is you are using non-English text. There is more information on php.net about
    installing the IMAP extension. If you have control over your server, it is
    often not hard to install.</p>

<p>On Ubuntu, try
    sudo apt-get install php5-imap</p>

<p>On Fedora, try
    sudo yuminstall php-imap</p>

<p>The IMAP extension is known to be installed on the following popular webhosts:
    * Dreamhost</p>

<h4 id='answer-15'>How can I embed youtube or vimeo videos?</h4>

<p>Simply put the url in the body of your e-mail. (Make sure that you have the
    option to convert url into links turned on)</p>
