<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Either:

        <ul>
            <li>Put the postie.zip file in wp-content/plugins/ and unzip it</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Or:

        <ul>
            <li>Use the automatic installer (WP 2.7+)</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Login to WordPress as an administrator</li>
    <li>Goto the Plugins tab in the WordPress Admin Site</li>
    <li>Activate "Postie"</li>
    <li>Goto to the "Settings" tab and click on the sub-tab "Postie" to configure it.</li>
    <li>Make sure you enter the mailserver information correctly, including the type
        of connection and the port number. Common port configurations:

        <ul>
            <li>pop3: 110 </li>
            <li>pop3-ssl: 995</li>
            <li>imap: 143</li>
            <li>imap-ssl: 993</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>(Postie ignores the settings under Settings-&gt;Writing-&gt;Writing-by-Email)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automating checking e-mail</h4>

<p>By default, postie checks for new e-mail every 30 minutes. You can select from
    a number of different checking intervals in the settings page, under the
    mailserver tab.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to have more fine-grained control of how postie checks
    for mail, you can also set up a crontab. This is for advanced users only.
    If your site runs on a UNIX/linux server, and you have shell access, you can
    enable mail checking using cron; if you don't know anything about cron, skip
    to the cronless postie section.</p>

<p>Setup a cronjob to pull down the get&#095;mail.php
    Examples:</p>

<p>*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source <a href="http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get&#095;mail.php" rel="nofollow">http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get&#095;mail.php</a> &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>This fetches the mail every five minutes with lynx</p>

<p>*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O /dev/null <a href="http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get&#095;mail.php" rel="nofollow">http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get&#095;mail.php</a> &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>This fetches the mail every ten minutes with wget</p>	<hr />
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>Postie won't connect to my mailserver. Why Not?</h4>

<p>Make sure the port you are using is open. For example, bluehost seems to block
    ports 993 and 995 (for pop3-ssl and imap-ssl) by default. I have heard that
    you can request that they open them for you ( you might have to pay extra).</p>

<p>You can check for open ports with the following command on your server:
    netstat -ln|grep -E ':::(993|995|143)'</p>

<p>If nothing shows up, then the ports are not open.</p>

<h4>How can I get postie to display inline images?</h4>

<p>Make sure that you send e-mail formatted as html (richtext), and set postie to
    prefer html messages (in the message tab of the postie settings)</p>

<h4>Mail is not showing up right when I send html (rich formatted) e-mail!</h4>

<p>Make sure you set the preferred text type to html</p>

<h4>Do I need to any code to my theme for postie to work?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4>I read somewhere to add an iframe to my footer. Should I do this?</h4>

<p>No. Do not add an iframe in your footer to get postie to check mail
    periodically. To check e-mail periodically, either set-up a cron job, or use
    cronless postie. See installation instructions</p>

<h4>My mail host requires SSL, but postie will not allow me to select pop3-ssl or imap-ssl</h4>

<p>You must have php-imap installed on your server for this to work. Ask your
    hosting provider about this.</p>

<h4>Can I use postie to check a gmail account?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can use either pop3-ssl or imap-ssl with a gmail account. Before
    attempting to use with postie, make sure that you enable pop or imap in your
    gmail preferences.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pop3 settings:

        <ul>
            <li>protocol - pop3-ssl</li>
            <li>server - pop.gmail.com</li>
            <li>port - 995</li>
            <li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is <a href="mailto:foo@gmail.com">foo@gmail.com</a>,
                this would be just foo)</li>
            <li>password - your password </li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>IMAP settings:

        <ul>
            <li>protocol - imap-ssl</li>
            <li>server - imap.gmail.com</li>
            <li>port - 993</li>
            <li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is <a href="mailto:foo@gmail.com">foo@gmail.com</a>,
                this would be just foo)</li>
            <li>password - your password </li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>My posts show up as being posted by 'admin' instead of me. Why?</h4>

<p>If your admin account is linked to <a href="mailto:bar@gmail.com">bar@gmail.com</a>, and you send mail from
    <a href="mailto:bar@gmail.com">bar@gmail.com</a>, it will show up as being posted by admin. If you have a
    wordpress user named "John Doe", which is linked to <a href="mailto:johndoe@gmail.com">johndoe@gmail.com</a>, make
    sure that you send e-mails from <a href="mailto:johndoe@gmail.com">johndoe@gmail.com</a>. It doesn't matter which
    e-mail address postie is checking. That is, if you send mail from
    <a href="mailto:johndoe@gmail.com">johndoe@gmail.com</a> to <a href="mailto:foo@gmail.com">foo@gmail.com</a>, it gets posted as "John Doe".</p>

<p>If you send an e-mail to your postie address from an e-mail address that is no
    t linked to a wordpress user, it will get posted as admin.</p>

<h4>Images aren't showing up at all?</h4>

<p>There are a couple possible reasons for this. First, check to see if you can
    add an image through wordpress's normal posting mechanism. If not, then there
    is probably 1 or 2 problems:
    1. Your server does not have the php-gd library installed. Ask your hosting
    provider about this.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your wp-content/uploads directory is not writable by the webserver. Make
        sure that it is</li>
</ol>

<h4>Can I delete the wp-files directory needed by postie version &lt;1.3.0?</h4>

<p>If you have posts published already by older versions of postie, getting rid
    of those directories will delete any files you might have had associated with
    those old posts. If you don't have any such posts, then you can safely delete
    them.</p>

<h4>How can I get rid of stupid stuff my e-mail provider adds to my messages?</h4>

<p>To strip off stuff that they add at the beginning of a message, start your
    post with :start</p>

<p>To strip off stuff that they add at the end of a message, end your
    post with :end</p>

<h4>How can I add custom attachment icons?</h4>

<p>Simply upload the icons you want to the postie/icons/custom directory. You
    must name the icons according to the following scheme:
    {filetype}-{size}.png</p>

<p>For example, for word documents, you could use:</p>

<pre><code>doc-32.png</code></pre>

<p>for a 32x32 pixel icon. (You can actually create any size icon you want, but
    if you name it 32, then it will only be used if you select to use size 32
    icons)</p>

<p>See the other directories in icons for more examples.</p>

<p>Currently the following filetypes are supported:</p>

<ul>
    <li>doc - microsoft word (including docx)</li>
    <li>ppt - microsoft powerpoint (including pptx)</li>
    <li>xls - microsoft excel (including xlsx)</li>
    <li>numbers - iWork numbres spreadsheet</li>
    <li>pages - iWork pages document</li>
    <li>key - iWork keynote presentation</li>
    <li>pdf - portable document format</li>
    <li>rtf - rich text format</li>
    <li>txt - plain text document</li>
</ul>

<h4>Can I add special text to the body of the post when using postie?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
    Two short examples are included in the filterPostie.php.sample file</p>

<h4>Can I add special text to the title of the post when using postie?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
    Two short examples are included in the filterPostie.php.sample file</p>

<h4>Can I select tags or categories based on the content of the e-mail?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
    See the filterPostie.php.sample file for examples.</p>

<h4>Is the IMAP extension required for postie?</h4>

<p>The IMAP extension is not required, but it is strongly recommended, especially
    is you are using non-English text. There is more information on php.net about
    installing the IMAP extension. If you have control over your server, it is
    often not hard to install.</p>

<p>On Ubuntu, try
    sudo apt-get install php5-imap</p>

<p>On Fedora, try
    sudo yuminstall php-imap</p>

<p>The IMAP extension is known to be installed on the following popular webhosts:
    * Dreamhost</p>

<h4>How can I embed youtube or vimeo videos?</h4>

<p>Simply put the url in the body of your e-mail. (Make sure that you have the
    option to convert url into links turned on)</p>	<hr />

<h4>1.1.1</h4>

<p>Below is all the of the version information. As far as I can tell there once was a guy named John Blade. He took some of the original wp-mail.php code 
    and started hacking away on it. He actually got pretty far. About the time I discovered WordPress and his little hack - called WP-Mail at the time - he 
    went on a vacation or something. There were some problems with the script, and it was missing some features I wanted. I hacked away at it and got it 
    into a place where it did what I wanted. I started posting about it since I figured other people might want the features.</p>

<p>John didn't release any more versions at least up til July 2005. So I started accepting submissions and feature requests from people to help make the 
    code better. In June/July 2005 I discovered a little plugin by Chris J Davis (<a href="http://www.chrisjdavis.org/cjd-notepad/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrisjdavis.org/cjd-notepad/</a>) called notepad. I added a small 
    feature to it (basically a bookmarklet).  In the process I started looking at his code and realized how much you could do with the plugin system 
    available in Word Press.</p>

<p>So I decided to make an offical fork. I put up an article on my blog asking for new names. I picked Postie.  I then modified the code to be a proper 
    plugin.  And the rest is history :)</p>

    <dd>Fixed possible XSS attack vulnerability</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id='Usage'>Usage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you put in :start - the message processing won't start until it sees that string</li>
    <li>If you put in :end - the message processing will stop once it sees that string</li>
    <li>Posts can be delayed by adding a line with delayXdXhXm where X is a number.

        <ul>
            <li>delay:1d - 1 day</li>
            <li>delay:1h - 1 hour</li>
            <li>delay:1m - 1 minute</li>
            <li>delay:1d2h4m - 1 day 2 hours 4m</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>By putting comments:X in your message you can control if comments are allowed

        <ul>
            <li>comments:0 - means closed</li>
            <li>comments:1 - means open</li>
            <li>comments:2 - means registered only</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Replying to an e-mail gets posted as a comment. 

        <ul>
            <li>For example, you e-mailed a post with the subject line "foo".
                If you then send an e-mail with the subject line "Re: foo", it will
                get posted as a comment to the "foo" post. This works by the subject
                line, so if you have two posts with titles "foo", then the comment
                will get placed in the more recent post.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Custom excerpt

        <ul>
            <li>You can include a custom excerpt of an e-mail by putting it between
                :excerptstart and :excerptend</li>
            <li>You can include images in the excerpt by using the shortcode #eimg1#,
                #eimg2# etc.</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Category and tag handling</h4>

<ul>
    <li>If you put a category name in the subject with a : it will be used
        as the category for the post</li>
    <li>If you put a category id number in the subject with a : it will
        be used as the category for the post</li>
    <li><p>If you put the first part of a category name it will be posted in
            the first category that the system finds that matches - so if you put</p>

        <p>Subject: Gen: New News</p>

        <p>The system will post that in General.</p></li>
    <li><p>All of the above also applies if you put the category in brackets []</p></li>
    <li><p>Using [] or you can post to multiple categories at once</p>

        <p>Subject: [1] [Mo] [Br] My Subject</p>

        <p>On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time</p></li>
    <li><p>Using - or you can post to multiple categories at once</p>

        <p>Subject: -1- -Mo- -Br- My Subject</p>

        <p>On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time</p></li>
    <li>You can add tags by adding a line in the body of the message like so:
        tags: foo, bar</li>
    <li>You can also set a default tag to be applied if no tags are included.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Image Handling</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Allows you to attach images to your email and automatically post
        them to your blog</li>
    <li>You can publish images in the text of your message by using #img1#
        #img2# - each one will be replaced with the HTML for the image
        you attached</li>
    <li><p>Captions - you can also add a caption like so:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>#img1 caption='foo'#</li>
            <li>#img2 caption='bar'#</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Or, if you use IPTC captions, this caption will be used  (adding a caption
            in many photo editing programs (for example Picasa), will add an IPTC caption)</p></li>
    <li><p>Image templates
            Postie now uses the default wordpress image template, but you can specify a
            different one if you wish.</p>

        <p>You can also specify a custom image template. I use the following custom
            template:</p></li>
</ul>

<a href='{IMAGE}'></a>{CAPTION}

<pre><code>* {THUMBNAIL} gets replaced with the url to the thumbnail image
* {MEDIUM} gets replaced with the url to the medium-sized image
* {LARGE} gets replaced with the url to the large-sized image
* {FULL} gets replaced with the url to the full-sized image
* {FILENAME} gets replaced with the absolute path to the full-size image
* {RELFILENAME} gets replaced with the relative path to the full-size image
* {CAPTION} gets replaced with the caption you specified (if any)
* {WIDTH} gets replaced with width of the photo
* {HEIGHT} gets replaced with the height of the photo
</code></pre>

<h4>Interoperability</h4>

<ul>
    <li>If your mail client doesn't support setting the subject (nokia) you
        can do so by putting #your title here# at the begining of your message</li>
    <li>POP3,POP3-SSL,IMAP,IMAP-SSL now supported - last three require
        php-imap support</li>
    <li>The program understands enough about mime to not duplicate post
        if you send an HTML and plain text message</li>
    <li>Automatically confirms that you are installed correctly</li>

including the ability to assign categories by name, included pictures and
videos, and automatically strip off signatures. It also has support for both
imap and pop3, with the option for ssl with both.  For usage notes, see the
[other notes](other_notes) page

  * pop3-ssl: 995
  * imap: 143
  * imap-ssl: 993
* (Postie ignores the settings under Settings-&gt;Writing-&gt;Writing-by-Email)

= Automating checking e-mail =

By default, postie checks for new e-mail every 30 minutes. You can select from
a number of different checking intervals in the settings page, under the
mailserver tab.

If you would prefer to have more fine-grained control of how postie checks
for mail, you can also set up a crontab. This is for advanced users only.
If your site runs on a UNIX/linux server, and you have shell access, you can
enable mail checking using cron; if you don&#039;t know anything about cron, skip
to the cronless postie section.

Setup a cronjob to pull down the get\_mail.php
Examples:

*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get\_mail.php &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

This fetches the mail every five minutes with lynx 

*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O /dev/null http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get\_mail.php &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

This fetches the mail every ten minutes with wget 

== Usage ==
* If you put in :start - the message processing won&#039;t start until it sees that string
* If you put in :end - the message processing will stop once it sees that string
* Posts can be delayed by adding a line with delayXdXhXm where X is a number.
  *    delay:1d - 1 day
  *    delay:1h - 1 hour
  *    delay:1m - 1 minute
  *    delay:1d2h4m - 1 day 2 hours 4m
* By putting comments:X in your message you can control if comments are allowed
   *   comments:0 - means closed
   *   comments:1 - means open
   *   comments:2 - means registered only
* Replying to an e-mail gets posted as a comment. 
  * For example, you e-mailed a post with the subject line &quot;foo&quot;.
    If you then send an e-mail with the subject line &quot;Re: foo&quot;, it will
    get posted as a comment to the &quot;foo&quot; post. This works by the subject
    line, so if you have two posts with titles &quot;foo&quot;, then the comment
    will get placed in the more recent post.
* Custom excerpt
  * You can include a custom excerpt of an e-mail by putting it between
    :excerptstart and :excerptend
    * You can include images in the excerpt by using the shortcode #eimg1#,
      #eimg2# etc.

= Category and tag handling =
* If you put a category name in the subject with a : it will be used
  as the category for the post
* If you put a category id number in the subject with a : it will
  be used as the category for the post
* If you put the first part of a category name it will be posted in
  the first category that the system finds that matches - so if you put

  Subject: Gen: New News

  The system will post that in General.

* All of the above also applies if you put the category in brackets []
* Using [] or you can post to multiple categories at once

  Subject: [1] [Mo] [Br] My Subject

  On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time

* Using - or you can post to multiple categories at once

  Subject: -1- -Mo- -Br- My Subject

  On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time
* You can add tags by adding a line in the body of the message like so:
  tags: foo, bar
* You can also set a default tag to be applied if no tags are included.

= Image Handling =
* Allows you to attach images to your email and automatically post
  them to your blog
* You can publish images in the text of your message by using #img1#
  #img2# - each one will be replaced with the HTML for the image
  you attached
* Captions - you can also add a caption like so:

    * #img1 caption=&#039;foo&#039;#
    * #img2 caption=&#039;bar&#039;#
  
  Or, if you use IPTC captions, this caption will be used  (adding a caption
  in many photo editing programs (for example Picasa), will add an IPTC caption)

* Image templates
  Postie now uses the default wordpress image template, but you can specify a
different one if you wish.

  You can also specify a custom image template. I use the following custom
template:

  &lt;div class=&#039;imageframe alignleft&#039;&gt;&lt;a href=&#039;{IMAGE}&#039;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{THUMBNAIL}&quot;
  alt=&quot;{CAPTION}&quot; title=&quot;{CAPTION}&quot; 
  class=&quot;attachment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div
class=&#039;imagecaption&#039;&gt;{CAPTION}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     
    * {THUMBNAIL} gets replaced with the url to the thumbnail image
    * {MEDIUM} gets replaced with the url to the medium-sized image
    * {LARGE} gets replaced with the url to the large-sized image
    * {FULL} gets replaced with the url to the full-sized image
    * {FILENAME} gets replaced with the absolute path to the full-size image
    * {RELFILENAME} gets replaced with the relative path to the full-size image
    * {CAPTION} gets replaced with the caption you specified (if any)
    * {WIDTH} gets replaced with width of the photo
    * {HEIGHT} gets replaced with the height of the photo

= Interoperability =
* If your mail client doesn&#039;t support setting the subject (nokia) you
  can do so by putting #your title here# at the begining of your message
* POP3,POP3-SSL,IMAP,IMAP-SSL now supported - last three require
  php-imap support
* The program understands enough about mime to not duplicate post
  if you send an HTML and plain text message
* Automatically confirms that you are installed correctly

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Postie won&#039;t connect to my mailserver. Why Not? =

Make sure the port you are using is open. For example, bluehost seems to block
ports 993 and 995 (for pop3-ssl and imap-ssl) by default. I have heard that
you can request that they open them for you ( you might have to pay extra). 

You can check for open ports with the following command on your server:
netstat -ln|grep -E &#039;:::(993|995|143)&#039;

If nothing shows up, then the ports are not open.

= How can I get postie to display inline images? =

Make sure that you send e-mail formatted as html (richtext), and set postie to
prefer html messages (in the message tab of the postie settings)

= Mail is not showing up right when I send html (rich formatted) e-mail! =

Make sure you set the preferred text type to html

= Do I need to any code to my theme for postie to work? =

No. 

= I read somewhere to add an iframe to my footer. Should I do this? =

No. Do not add an iframe in your footer to get postie to check mail
periodically. To check e-mail periodically, either set-up a cron job, or use
cronless postie. See installation instructions

= My mail host requires SSL, but postie will not allow me to select pop3-ssl or imap-ssl =

You must have php-imap installed on your server for this to work. Ask your
hosting provider about this.

= Can I use postie to check a gmail account? =

Yes. You can use either pop3-ssl or imap-ssl with a gmail account. Before
attempting to use with postie, make sure that you enable pop or imap in your
gmail preferences.

* Pop3 settings:
    * protocol - pop3-ssl
    * server - pop.gmail.com
    * port - 995
    * userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is foo@gmail.com,
      this would be just foo)
    * password - your password 
* IMAP settings:
    * protocol - imap-ssl
    * server - imap.gmail.com
    * port - 993
    * userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is foo@gmail.com,
      this would be just foo)
    * password - your password 

= My posts show up as being posted by &#039;admin&#039; instead of me. Why? =

If your admin account is linked to bar@gmail.com, and you send mail from
bar@gmail.com, it will show up as being posted by admin. If you have a
wordpress user named &quot;John Doe&quot;, which is linked to johndoe@gmail.com, make
sure that you send e-mails from johndoe@gmail.com. It doesn&#039;t matter which
e-mail address postie is checking. That is, if you send mail from
johndoe@gmail.com to foo@gmail.com, it gets posted as &quot;John Doe&quot;. 

If you send an e-mail to your postie address from an e-mail address that is no
t linked to a wordpress user, it will get posted as admin.

= Images aren&#039;t showing up at all? =

There are a couple possible reasons for this. First, check to see if you can
add an image through wordpress&#039;s normal posting mechanism. If not, then there
is probably 1 or 2 problems:
1. Your server does not have the php-gd library installed. Ask your hosting
provider about this.

2. Your wp-content/uploads directory is not writable by the webserver. Make
sure that it is

= Can I delete the wp-files directory needed by postie version &lt;1.3.0? =

If you have posts published already by older versions of postie, getting rid
of those directories will delete any files you might have had associated with
those old posts. If you don&#039;t have any such posts, then you can safely delete
them.

= How can I get rid of stupid stuff my e-mail provider adds to my messages? =

To strip off stuff that they add at the beginning of a message, start your
post with :start

To strip off stuff that they add at the end of a message, end your
post with :end

= How can I add custom attachment icons? =

Simply upload the icons you want to the postie/icons/custom directory. You
must name the icons according to the following scheme:
{filetype}-{size}.png

For example, for word documents, you could use:

`doc-32.png`

for a 32x32 pixel icon. (You can actually create any size icon you want, but
if you name it 32, then it will only be used if you select to use size 32
icons)

See the other directories in icons for more examples.

Currently the following filetypes are supported:

* doc - microsoft word (including docx)
* ppt - microsoft powerpoint (including pptx)
* xls - microsoft excel (including xlsx)
* numbers - iWork numbres spreadsheet
* pages - iWork pages document
* key - iWork keynote presentation
* pdf - portable document format
* rtf - rich text format
* txt - plain text document

= Can I add special text to the body of the post when using postie? =

Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
Two short examples are included in the filterPostie.php.sample file

= Can I add special text to the title of the post when using postie? =

Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
Two short examples are included in the filterPostie.php.sample file

= Can I select tags or categories based on the content of the e-mail? =

Yes. You can create your own function, and use the postie_post filter.
See the filterPostie.php.sample file for examples.

= Is the IMAP extension required for postie? =

The IMAP extension is not required, but it is strongly recommended, especially
is you are using non-English text. There is more information on php.net about
installing the IMAP extension. If you have control over your server, it is
often not hard to install. 

On Ubuntu, try
sudo apt-get install php5-imap

On Fedora, try
sudo yuminstall php-imap

The IMAP extension is known to be installed on the following popular webhosts:
* Dreamhost

= How can I embed youtube or vimeo videos? =

Simply put the url in the body of your e-mail. (Make sure that you have the
option to convert url into links turned on)

Below is all the of the version information. As far as I can tell there once was a guy named John Blade. He took some of the original wp-mail.php code 
and started hacking away on it. He actually got pretty far. About the time I discovered WordPress and his little hack - called WP-Mail at the time - he 
went on a vacation or something. There were some problems with the script, and it was missing some features I wanted. I hacked away at it and got it 
into a place where it did what I wanted. I started posting about it since I figured other people might want the features. 

John didn&#039;t release any more versions at least up til July 2005. So I started accepting submissions and feature requests from people to help make the 
code better. In June/July 2005 I discovered a little plugin by Chris J Davis (http://www.chrisjdavis.org/cjd-notepad/) called notepad. I added a small 
feature to it (basically a bookmarklet).  In the process I started looking at his code and realized how much you could do with the plugin system 
available in Word Press.

So I decided to make an offical fork. I put up an article on my blog asking for new names. I picked Postie.  I then modified the code to be a proper 
plugin.  And the rest is history :)
